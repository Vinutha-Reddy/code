"""LAB PROGRAM 05: Develop a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the randomly generated 100 
values of x in the range of [0,1]. Perform the following based on dataset generated. 
a. Label the first 50 points {x1,……,x50} as follows: if (xi ≤ 0.5), then xi ∊ Class1, else xi ∊ Class1 
b. Classify the remaining points, x51,……,x100 using KNN. Perform this for k=1,2,3,4,5,20,30"""
